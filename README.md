## Sales of a Super store

In this project, I analysed the data to find the best insights I could possibly get.
This data is about sales of a superstore in different states in the United States.
I analysed the Profit the superstore can get according to its area.
Each category has a sub-category and all those data has also been analysed. Ex.
Sub-Categories, Regions, Sum of sales, Sum of Quanity etc.
